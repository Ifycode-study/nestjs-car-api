## Install typeorm and DB
````
npm i @nestjs/typeorm typeorm sqlite3
````

## Database connection setup
Database name is db.sqlite as written in the appModuleinside the TypeOrmModule object. Starting your development server in the terminal will cause a file called db.sqlite to be generated in the root of the project (I've added this file to gitignore since I don't know if iit's safe to upload it to github).

## Creating an entity
- Create an entity file: The class in the fiile will list all the properties that your entity will have.
- Connect the entity to it's parent moduule - this creates an entity.
- Connect the entity to the root i.e. the appModule.

## Viewing a DB's content: Using vscode SQLite extension
You will only be able to view the generated db.sqlite file the first time you open it up with the editor. To view the DB's content, you need to install an external extension or program. Using vscode extension:
- Install "SQLite" from vscode extension
- Still in vscode, go to view > command pallete
- Search for "SQLite: open database"
- Click on the database name which is same as the one in the root of your project

After these, you'll find a "sqlite explorer" collapsible dropdown towards the bottom of your vscode explorer. You will find your DB content in there.

## TypeORM synchronize property

`Synchronize: true` should only be used in development, and should not be used in production. SQL database is usually very rigid. To make any changes to the structure of an SQL database/table (e.g. create or remove tables or columns, or even changing the type of data stored iin the columns), you would usually need to write "migration" code. By setting synchronize to true, typeORM will automatically do such migration. It is dangerous to use this in production so that you don't accidentally delete data for example. You need to write migration code for production.

## Understanding typeORM decorators

## Quick note on repositories
Check out the repository API for the different methods you can use on a DB at the [typeORM's official documentation](https://typeorm.io/#/repository-api).

## A few extra routes: Just to help understand typeORM
Note: Yellow portin not needed for our app. Those routes are only created to help understand typeORM.
